# Habit Tracker

## Problem

Users struggle with maintaining daily habits due to friction and poor feedback loops.

## My Approach

I built the system using App Router and Server Components
to minimize client bundle size and improve TTFB.

## Architecture Decisions

- Server-first data fetching
- Convex for real-time sync
- Minimal client state

## Performance Strategy

<MetricBadge label="Lighthouse" value="96" />
<MetricBadge label="TTFB" value="120ms" />

Bundle size was reduced by 35% by removing unnecessary client hydration.
