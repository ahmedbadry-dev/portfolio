## Overview

Tenzies is a browser-based dice game implementing selective reroll logic and value-lock enforcement through immutable state transitions.

---

## The Problem

Build a deterministic dice game where:

- Players lock dice
- Only matching values can be locked after first selection
- Only unlocked dice reroll
- Win when all dice are locked

---

## Architecture Strategy

- Main component owns state
- Presentational components separated
- Seed data stored in local module
- Immutable updates via `map` and spread
- Functional state transitions

---

## Performance Strategy

- Small fixed array (10 dice)
- O(n) state updates
- Conditional confetti rendering
- Functional updates prevent stale reads

---

## Security & Validation

- Controlled input via semantic buttons
- Rule-based lock enforcement
- Typed components and props
- Stable ID-based list rendering

---

## Complex Engineering Challenges

- Enforcing first-lock value constraint
- Selective reroll logic
- Win derivation correctness
- Replay reset flow

---

## Deep Architecture

(See architecture visual below.)

---

## What I Learned

- Derived state is cleaner than manual flags
- Functional updates guarantee transition safety
- Immutable updates simplify reasoning
- Even small games benefit from architectural discipline

---

## Outcome

Delivered a production-ready interactive dice game with:

- Deterministic state transitions
- Rule-based lock enforcement
- Replay lifecycle
- Automated CI deployment
