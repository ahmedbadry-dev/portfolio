## Overview

Product Feedback is a client-side feedback lifecycle system built with React and Redux Toolkit.

It models relational domain data (suggestions and comments) entirely in local state while enforcing cross-entity consistency through centralized reducers.

---

## The Problem

A feedback board must support:

- Suggestion CRUD
- Comment lifecycle
- Upvote toggling
- Roadmap grouping
- Derived state aggregation

All without backend infrastructure.

---

## Architecture Strategy

### Rendering Model

Client-side SPA using nested routing.

### State Architecture

Single Redux slice:
```ts
{
  suggestions: Suggestion[],
  comments: { [suggestionId]: Comment[] }
}
```

---

### Routing Strategy

- Route-driven modal pattern
- Nested layout composition
- Wildcard fallback redirect

---

## Performance Strategy

- `useMemo` for roadmap count derivation.
- `useMemo` for feedback lookup by id.
- `useCallback` for stable handlers.
- Single-pass aggregation loop.
- O(1) comment lookup via keyed object map.

All updates are synchronous local state writes.

---

## Security & Validation

- Required field validation.
- Comment length capped at 250.
- Trim-based empty check.
- Destructive delete confirmation.
- Invalid route guard.

No external input surface or backend exposure.

---

## Complex Engineering Challenges

- Maintaining relational consistency without normalization.
- Preventing negative upvotes.
- Synchronizing route-driven modals with state.
- Ensuring deterministic derived state aggregation.

---

## Deep Architecture

(See architecture visual below.)

---

## What I Learned

- Client-side relational modeling increases reducer responsibility.
- Denormalized state improves read performance.
- Route-driven modals reduce global UI state complexity.
- Entity normalization would scale better long-term.
- Domain logic discipline is critical without backend authority.

---

## Outcome

Delivered a deployable SPA feedback system with:

- Relational state modeling
- Route-driven UX flows
- Deterministic reducer consistency
- CI-based GitHub Pages deployment
